/*Implementing teams and players in OOP with generics*/
package com.practice;
// EXEMPLARY CODE

// ArrayList<Team> teams;
// Collections.sort(teams);
// Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport.
// The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store
// a list of teams that belong to the league.
//
// Your class should have a method to print out the teams in order,
// with the team at the top of the league printed first.
//
// Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular
// instance of the league class - the program should fail to compile
// if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
